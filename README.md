# OpenDC

OpenDC is meant to be an open standard for dossier of competencies (DC).


## Why?

DCs are a somewhat common thing that's asked by several companies during their recruitment process.

Even though they usually all have the same fields, candidates have to fill out what turns out to be the same file with some different formatting.

OpenDC is meant to be a standard to help with this issue: a single file format that candidates can fill out once and just update. Since this file contains all the information that's also in CVs, it can also be used as a replacement for one.


## Pros

### Companies

- Easy to import
- Faster to collect basic information

### Candidates

- Less work rewriting
